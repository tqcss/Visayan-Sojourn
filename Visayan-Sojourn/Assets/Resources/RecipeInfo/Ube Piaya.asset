  description: Negros Occidental's Ube Piaya is a delightful fusion of traditional
    flavors, combining the vibrant purple goodness of ube (purple yam) with the beloved
    sweetness of piaya. The unique treat features a filling made from mashed ube
    and sugar, encased in a flaky, thin pastry that's cooked to golden perfection.
    This sweet delicacy pays homage to Negros Occidental's agricultural richness,
    as the province is known for producing quality ube. Often enjoyed as either snack
    or pasalubong (gift), Ube Piaya encapsulates the province's culinary ingenuity
    and its commitment to celebrating local ingredients in a deliciously distinct
    way.
