  description: Adobo nga Baka, another type of Adobo, is a savory beef stew popular
    in Capiz. It is a delicacy made with beef, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and bay
    leaves. It is simmered until the beef is tender, and the sauce has thickened.
    The dish is savory and slightly sour, with a tangy flavor from the vinegar. It
    is best served with steamed rice. Baka or beef is a common source of protein
    in the province and other pantry staples are already available at any household
    pantry, leading to the making of the dish. The dish is often served at special
    occassions, such as fiestas and family gatherings, a popular delicacy to cook
    for visitors.
