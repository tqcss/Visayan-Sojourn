  description: "Bandi, a beloved native delicacy in Antique, holds a sweetness crunchy
    bomb and an essential epitome to the local livelihood and culture. As buses and
    vans, filled with both locals and tourists, traverse the region daily, drivers
    often ask about getting \"pasalubong\", leading them to stop at stores where
    Bandi is crafted and sold. This sweet treat has been a common livelihood for
    Antique\xF1o families, with many stores passing down the tradition to predecessors,
    preserving the art of Bandi-making as an integral part of the region's heritage."
